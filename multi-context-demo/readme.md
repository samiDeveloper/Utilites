A functional module is the implementation of a bounded context.
A module is independent and functionally cohesive, isolated as much as possible from other modules and its environment.

Technologies used:

- java 8
- servlet 3 using ServletContainerInitializer instead of web.xml
- spring 4.1.6 using annotation only
- jpa / hibernate
- jetty 9
- lombok
