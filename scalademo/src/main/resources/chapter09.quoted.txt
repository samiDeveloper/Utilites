Explanation: "It's back". Never before has an observed "supernova" been predicted. 
The unique "astronomical event" occurred in the field of galaxy cluster "\sMACS \"J1149.\\"5+2223". 
Most bright spots in the featured image are galaxies in this cluster. 
The actual supernova, dubbed Supernova Refsdal, occurred just once far across the universe and well behind this "massive" galaxy cluster.
